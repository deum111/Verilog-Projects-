The functionality of a JK Flip Flop is demonstrated through behavioral
modeling. The method used to accomplish this in the source code was by 
creating an always block with a trigger on the positive edge of a clock stated in
the sensitivity list of the always block. Followed by case statements of non-blocking
assignments to execute the operation.
