//State how many hours it took to complete the project.

Design a processor that would calculate the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers. 
Use Euclidean Algorithm.

The report should include the cover page, the problem statement, 
explanation of your approach including the reuse of previously developed modules, 
a block diagram, ASM-D charts, Verilog codes used, and the waveforms screen-prints for each question.

State problems encountered at simulation how they were resolved.
Display the initial values and how they are reduced to GCD using the 7 segment displays.
