The source code and testbench used for the assigment: GCD.v and tb_GCD
The code calculates the greatest common divisor between two integers and 
displays the values on to a seven segment display. 
Simulation waveform output is explained in the testbench for Euclid_GCD

The verilog file labeled Eulcid_GCD.v and tb_Euclid_GCD.v are updated codes
created based on code from the following link:
http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp10/cse141L/pdf/02/02-Verilog2.pdf
It is designed to be synthesizable, however, the seven segment display 
was not implemented for the Nexys4 DDR Artix-7 Board. 
The code (Euclid_GCD) was for practicing more eficient design and functions.
