Program counter keeps the memory address of the instruction read to Instruction Register.

Controls in Program Counter Design:

PC_inc – increments the value in the Program Counter

PC_clr – resets the Program Counter to zero

PC_ld – loads the value calculated in the OFFSET into the Program Counter

OFFSET is used when a branching or PC offset instruction is executed. 
The instruction carries an 8 bit offset in the IR[7:0] bits.

The formula a + b -1 should be read as:

The new PC = previous PC + Offset -1

the -1 is to compensate for the PC increment that would happen prior to reading the next instruction.
