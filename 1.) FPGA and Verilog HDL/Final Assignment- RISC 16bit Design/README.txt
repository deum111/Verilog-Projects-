Final assignment to create a RISC 16-bit, 16-instruction 16-Register Design.
Assignment required successful implementation of at least 11/16 instructions for 
completion of assignment. Conditional branch operations and Program Count Jump operations
are for bonuses for each successful operation implemented. 

The opcodes from the five instruction classes detailed in file "Final Project ISA p1.pdf" should 
be used.
Design is given in "RISC Design Layout.doc" file
