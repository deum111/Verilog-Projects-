The files in this folder include lab assignments that I completed
in Intro to VLSI Design. 

The programs used were Vivado to create verilog code, Cadence Virtuoso and Encounter to 
create physical designs from the verilog code.

Tutorials for using the Cadence and Synopsys software were provided by the instructor.
